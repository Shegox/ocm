If the type CTF is specified the target must already exist, if CTF flavor
is specified it will be created if it does not exist.

Besides those explicitly known types a complete repository spec might be configured,
either via inline argument or command configuration file and name.

The <code>--type</code> option accepts a file format for the
target archive to use. The following formats are supported:
- directory
- tar
- tgz
The default format is <code>directory</code>.
